<h1>Numerical Integration</h1>

Performs numerical integration on x-y data. Uses __Simpson's Rule__ where applicable, and the __Trapezoidal Rule__ in all other cases.

<br>

__Simpson's 1/3 Rule:__

Approximates a function using __2nd order polynomials__.

For ___n___ equal segments (_i.e._, ___n+1___ evenly spaced data points), the definite integral can be approximated as follows. Note that ___n___ must be __even__.

Here ```(b-a)/n``` is the spacing between data points.

__Simpson's 3/8 Rule:__

Approximates a function using __3rd order polynomials__.

For ___n___ equal segments (_i.e._, ___n+1___ evenly spaced data points), the definite integral can be approximated as follows. Note that ___n___ must be __an integer multiple of 3__.

Here ```(b-a)/n``` is the spacing between data points.

__Trapezoidal Rule:__

Approximates a function using __trapezoids__.

For ___n___ equal segments (_i.e._, ___n+1___ evenly spaced data points), the definite integral can be approximated as follows.

Here ```(b-a)/n``` is the spacing between data points.

__Test code:__

```
